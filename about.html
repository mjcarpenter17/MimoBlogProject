          <h3 class="post-title">Becoming a web developer</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>At the end of November 2017, I gratuated from UoP with a Bacholers degree in computer science.
            to be 100% honest, I thought that this was the end of my journey through education, and the begining of a
            professional carreer as a Software Engineer. What I didn't know at the time was, no compnay in the world is going
            to higher someone fresh out of college, with no experiance what so ever, to be a software engineer. This realization
            forced me to take a good hard look at what I really wanted to do for a career, and then set out on a journey that starts right here.</p>
            <p> I have been developing websites for quite sometime now. I want to say that my first website was created back in 2003, during my senior
              year of high school. HTML was a small, one trimester class that seemd interesting. I fell in love with creating webpages and have done it
              as a hobby ever scense. Since that that, I've tought myself diffrent tools and skills to aid in this hobby. Things like CSS, PHP,
              JavaScript, SQL, MySql, FTP, domain names, web hosting, etc. The thing about it is though, I never thought about having a career as a
              web developer. Up until now, in my mind, I thought a web developer was someone whoe designed, coded, and hosted a website.
              I thought they did it all, every piece of building a website and making it look pretty, make it run, make it interactive, hosting it,
              securing it, that's what a web developer is. Or so I thought.</p>
              <p>So, to cut to the chase. I want to be a web developer. I want to be a real web developer, which means relearning everything I know
                about creating websites. I'm creating this blog as my first step down this road and hopefully it's worth it. We'll see :)</p>
